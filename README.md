# BinarySearchTree
* Academic project developed in C ++, through IDE Netbeans 8.2.
* The project aims to explore and apply concepts of JAVA OOPs and Data Structure.
* "BinaryNode.h" and "BinarySearchTree.h" are theoretically already available in C++, but the manual construction of both aims to fix learning.
* "main.cpp", "Datas.h" and "Filmes.h" are the most important files in this project.
