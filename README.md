# BinarySearchTree
# Academic project developed in C ++, through IDE Netbeans 8.2.
# The project aims to explore and apply concepts of JAVA OOPs and Data Structure.
# "BinaryNode.h" and "BinarySearchTree.h" are theoretically already available in C++, but the manual construction of both aims to fix learning.
# "Datas.h" and "Filmes.h" were the classes created to implement the project.
